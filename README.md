# Simple Weather App
## A dashboard for gathering and rendering data for weather and location. 

Tools used:
- Express - unopinionated Node.js framework
- Node.js - the server
- Axios - make HTTP calls with less effort
- dotenv - loading those environment variables 
- nodemon - automatically restarts the server on file save
- WeatherAPI - real-time current weather service
- Google Places API - search for a location and get lat/long coordinates

To begin:
1. Clone this repo onto your local environment.
2. Create a `.env` for environment variables and create a variable for the listening port and the API key from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) (it's free).
3. Reference the `package.json` on what command to start your server with.
